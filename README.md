# Borne üêô

Welcome to Borne This project allows you to interact with Git and GitHub from the terminal in a simple and efficient way. Use this CLI to manage your repositories, branches, and commits without leaving the command line.

## Features üåü

- **Set the working directory**
- **Create new repositories**
- **Manage branches**: create, switch, and delete
- **Make commits and view history**
- **Set remote repositories**
- **Perform `pull` and `push` operations**

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Build the CLI: Open PowerShell and navigate to your project folder. Run the following command to compile the executable:

```shellscript
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o brn.exe
```

2. Set up the environment variable: Create a system environment variable named GITHUB_TOKEN and assign your GitHub token to it. To do this on Windows:
   -Search for "System Properties" in the start menu.
   -Select "Advanced system settings".
   -Click on "Environment Variables".
   -In "System variables", click on "New..." and add GITHUB_TOKEN as the variable name and your GitHub token as the value.

3. Add the .exe location to the system PATH: In the same "Environment Variables" window, find the Path variable, select it, and click "Edit". Add the path where brn.exe is located.
